- Worked under the R&D team and engineered high-throughput RAG pipelines to scale and replace Vectara endpoints within DeepLogicAIâ€™s enterprise search solutions.
- Outperformed query results from high-precision retrieval models such as ColBERT V2. Conducted rigorous trials across over 12 permutations of RAG pipelines for advanced components such as embedding models Re-ranker, Chunking, and Indexing, optimizing for peak performance.
- Work with sophisticated & large FastAPI code base for the implementation of the best pipelines on production side.
