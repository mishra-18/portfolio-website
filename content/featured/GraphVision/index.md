**Graph Vision** is a Python library that aims to create topological maps for an environment connecting neighboring image segments, capturing each segment's spatial and semantic feature embeddings.

Enables localization of objects relative to one another in the topology with language description of the objects using Dijkstra's algorithm. Check it out on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/graphvision/)
