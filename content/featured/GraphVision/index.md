**Graph Vision** is a Python library facilitating the generation of topological representations for image segments.

It also allows performing **visual queries** on the topological graph and retains not only the spatial but also semantic information for each segment, making it very useful for various tasks in robotics and localization. Check it out on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/graphvision/)
