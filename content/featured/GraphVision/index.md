**Graph Vision** is a Python library facilitating the generation of topological representations for image segments.

It also allows performing **visual queries** on the topological graph and retains not only the spatial but also semantic information for each segment, making it very useful for various tasks in **robotics**, **localization** and **Game Development**. Check it out on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/graphvision/)
