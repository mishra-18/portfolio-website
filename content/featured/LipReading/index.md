- Developed a 3DConv-LSTM (bi-directional) to predict the spoken sentence by extracting features from the lip movements in the frames based on End-to-End Sentence-level Lipreading.

- Utilized CTC Loss for training to handle the variable length of input alignments (spoken sentence) and weights initialized with He (Kaiming normal) initialization to avoid blank-index predictions.
