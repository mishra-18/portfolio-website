- Developed a <b>3DConv-LSTM</b> (bi-directional) to predict the spoken sentence by extracting features from the lip movements in the frames based on [End-to-End Sentence-level Lipreading](https://github.com/mishra-18/lipnet-pytorch).

- Utilized CTC Loss for training to handle the variable length of input alignments (spoken sentence) and weights initialized with <b>He</b> (Kaiming normal) initialization to avoid blank-index predictions.
